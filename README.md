# Mapping_Earthquakes
This project is both challenging and rewarding. It involved so many moving parts like a puzzle, and we did complete project by reflecting major tectonic activities on a map.

## Purpose of the project
* The main purpose of this project can be summarized as:
  - To be able to display tectonic activities like earthquakes on geographical map.
  - To display our data on different map styles:- street, satellite or dark.
  - To display the magnitude of earthquakes by assigning different colors.
  - To display the tectonic plates around the world.

## Result and Analysis
* Adding tectonic Plates:
  - Once we add our JS script to our `challenge_logic.js`, we were able to show all the tectonic plates of our world
   
   1. All tectonic plates:

   2. The most active tectonic plates:

  - The we edited our `challenge_logic.js` file to display our major earthquake data with distinct color and radius according to the magnitude of the earthquake.

  - Lastly, we added a script to our `challenge_logic.js` to display a dark mode of the map and it displayed perfectly.

## Conclusion

* The power of `JS` and `HTML` was shown in this project. Data visualization couldn't get more attractive, interactive and user friendly that this. Presenting this data to anyone with out any data interpretation skill, we can still convey the massage clearly.
